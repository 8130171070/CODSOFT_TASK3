🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Project

📂 Project Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements using supervised machine learning algorithms.
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets used for classification problems and is widely used for introductory data science and machine learning tasks.
